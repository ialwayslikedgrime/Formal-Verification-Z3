# Formal Methods & Automated Reasoning
This repository contains solutions to logic and verification problems using the **Z3 SMT Solver** and standard **SMT-LIB** syntax.

**Topics Covered:**
* First-Order Logic (Skolemization, Herbrand's Theorem, Ground Resolution)
* CDCL modulo Integer Difference Logic (CDCL(T) modulo IDL)
* Satisfiability checking and constraint solving for logical puzzles
